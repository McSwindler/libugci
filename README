libugci: Library to support Happ Controls' USB Game Controller Interface

http://www.swissdisk.com/~bcollins/ugci/

This library provides a poll/callback interface to certain events that
occur in the UGCI that are not normally handled by the input layer. For
example, Joysticks, Mouse, and Steering inputs are already handled.
However the Start/Coin is not.

To use this library you will need HIDDev compiled into your kernel with an
interface version of atleast 1.0.4. That can be found in recent 2.6 and
2.4 kernels.

Once compiled, you can then use the applications that support it
(currently xMAME, and soon to be snes9x) or create your own. The ugci.h
header is documented via comments, and there are several example programs.
